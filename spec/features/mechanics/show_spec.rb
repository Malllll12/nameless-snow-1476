# Story 2 - Mechanic Show Page
#
# As a user,
# When I visit a mechanic show page
# I see their name, years of experience, and the names of rides they’re working on
# And I only see rides that are open
# And the rides are listed by thrill rating in descending order (most thrills first)

# Story 3 - Add a Ride to a Mechanic
#
# As a user,
# When I go to a mechanics show page
# I see a form to add a ride to their workload
# When I fill in that field with an id of an existing ride and hit submit
# I’m taken back to that mechanic's show page
# And I see the name of that newly added ride on this mechanics show page
#
# Ex:
# Mechanic: Kara Smith
# Years of Experience: 11
#
# Current rides they’re working on:
# The Frog Hopper
# Fahrenheit
# The Kiss Raise
